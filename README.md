## Project Overview

This project implements Stage1 of the Self-Reference Deep Adaptive Curve Estimation (Self-DACE) method for low-light image enhancement. The implementation is based on the Zero-DCE architecture and focuses on learning pixel-wise curve parameters for image enhancement.

## Model

Model is in model.py

quick sanity test of model.py:

```bash
python model_test.py
```

Expected: prints shapes like:

```bash
enhanced: torch.Size([1, 3, 256, 256]) ...
alpha_stack: torch.Size([1, 21, 256, 256])
beta_stack : torch.Size([1, 21, 256, 256])
```

Used in training:
```bash
import torch
import model  # model.py

net = model.light_net().cuda().train()
# x0 in [0,1], shape Bx3xHxW
enhanced, alpha_stack, beta_stack = net(x0)
```
